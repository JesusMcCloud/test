This is a Kotlin Multiplatform library implementing features of the Austrian electronic pupil ID ([edu.digicard](https://www.bmbwf.gv.at/Themen/schule/zrp/dibi/itinf/itdienstleistungen/educard.html))
as [W3C Verifiable Credentials](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/).
It targets iOS and Android on the client side, as well as the JVM on the back-end.
It also contains JVM-only data classes to be consumed by an OpenAPI generator (i.e. Swagger)
